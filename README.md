## Project xylella 

My land is famous for the olive trees,but millions of them are dying because of a bacteria
called "xylella fastidiosa"
My project is to make a database of each olive tree in the country to monitor the movement of the plague
and set proper fast response actions.
The database accepts each tree as a token who can be updated , each token has as parameters the position and the number of clones
There's no cure for the sickness so the only way to prevent the spreading is to cut the tree and substitute with one of their clones
The database can be filled and updated by farmers with a proper forms
The database must be uploaded to the blockchain to use properly the EU fonds given as response to the plague.
It is sad that trees sometimes old tousands of years are destined to die but no one lives forever, and planting the clones in their
place will preserve the genetic caracteristics.
